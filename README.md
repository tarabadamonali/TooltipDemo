# About Application

A single page Angular app with simple routing that has one state/view. In it, there are two buttons that when clicked, show a tooltip above the button with some text in it.

When button A is clicked, if button Bâ€™s tooltip is open it will close and vice versa - only one tooltip will be visible at a time. Either tooltip will close when clicked anywhere outside of it, but remain open if clicked inside. Either tooltip will close when ESC key is pressed.

If you scroll down to an open tooltip it will detect being at the edge of the screen and change position to be below the butto
